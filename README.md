# Machine Learning for Clinical Meta-Analysis

## Thesis Overview
This project is centered around the development of a web application designed to streamline the analysis and synthesis of a vast corpus of studies, facilitating the conduction of clinical meta-analyses. The thesis discusses the application of various machine learning classifiers for the categorization of text, specifically focusing on the discrimination of sentences related to randomized clinical trials.

## Web Application
Developed with Python and the Dash framework, the web app provides a user-friendly interface, enabling researchers to efficiently search and access relevant papers using a PubMed-based query system and the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome).

## Machine Learning Models
The thesis explores traditional machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, and compares them with BioBert, a pre-trained model specialized in the biomedical domain. The objective is to assess the efficacy of traditional models against advanced approaches like BioBert in classifying randomized clinical trial descriptions.
