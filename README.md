# Bachelor's Thesis: Machine Learning for Clinical Meta-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the machine learning component of my Bachelor's thesis, which focuses on the classification of sentences from randomized clinical trial reports to assist in meta-analysis.

## Thesis Objectives
- To compare various machine learning models and their effectiveness in classifying medical literature.
- To facilitate the meta-analysis process by identifying relevant studies through a machine learning approach.

## Repository Contents
- `myClassifier.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that details the comparison of machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and BioBERT.
- `thesis.pdf`: The full thesis document detailing the project's background, methodology, and findings.

## How to Use
- Review `myClassifier.ipynb` to understand the model comparison approach.
- Refer to `thesis.pdf` for a comprehensive explanation of the entire project.

## Note
The web application code developed as part of this thesis is not included in this repository.
